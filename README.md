The "Customer Churn Prediction" project aims to predict which customers are likely to leave a company based on their data. The project starts by loading customer information, such as their demographics and behavior. Then, it prepares the data by cleaning and converting it into a format that can be used for analysis.

Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, are used to make predictions. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the models are trained to predict customer churn. After testing, the performance of both models is compared based on their accuracy, and the important factors that influence whether a customer will leave are identified.
